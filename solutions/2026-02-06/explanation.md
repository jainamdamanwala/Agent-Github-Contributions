# Container With Most Water

**ID:** 11  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/  

## Explanation

This problem can be solved by using a two-pointer approach. We start by initializing two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. We then calculate the area of water that can be trapped between the two lines and update the maximum area if necessary. We move the pointer of the shorter line towards the other pointer to maximize the area.
