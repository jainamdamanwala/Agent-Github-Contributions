# Maximum Subarray

**ID:** 53  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/  

## Explanation

This problem can be solved using Kadane's algorithm, which is a linear-time algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. The idea is to keep track of the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position and update the maximum sum found so far.
