# Container With Most Water

**ID:** 11  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/  

## Explanation

This problem can be solved by using a two-pointer technique. We start with two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. We calculate the area between the two lines and update the maximum area if necessary. We then move the pointer of the shorter line towards the other pointer to maximize the area.
